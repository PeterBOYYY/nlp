Maybe I should try writing the file to a disc at a slower speed? __eou__ __eot__ maybe, I guess anything goes at this stage, I have my share of bad luck in the past with installs, and I learned that it reaaly depends on *excactly* where the install gets stuck to know - what's causing it. __eou__ __eot__ and getting stuck after making the partition and copying files isn't one you're used too? :P __eou__ __eot__ also, I'm not sure if ubuntu keeps an install log anywhere, that would have been a dead giveaway to your problem. __eou__ well, yes, happend, it was bad Media. __eou__ __eot__ I'll just try writing the disc at a slower rate I guess. It's still stuck on that screen so I'll reset, reformat, and try to reinstall. __eou__ __eot__ sucks that you use Windows, if you have a machine that you can try and use this media on, you could see if the media is bad. __eou__ also, if you're going the ""bad media"" router, did you verify the MD5 on this download ? __eou__ route=router __eou__ __eot__ ",I didn't verify unfortunately but I figured getting a torrent right from the ubuntu DL page I wouldn't need too >.< __eou__,serial printer baby :) __eou__,my pleasure :) __eou__,just checking :) __eou__,I  grabbed the 3.0 driver as well.
